GET requests to 	https://api.weather.gov/points/40.948020935058594,-74.05921173095703 - gets info for shop in paramus

Pull info from api to Lat/Long coorrdinates.
TODO! Need to find a way to get proper lat and long coorrdinates!! Can mapping do this for me when getting addresses?

response.properties.forecast gives the proper forcast for the area for the next few days
response.properties.forecastHourly gives the next 3 hours

in forecast, number = id, name = when it is,  icon displays images. use 'size=small', 'size=medium' or 'size=large', other sizes DO NOT WORK
